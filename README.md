# Lego-Sets

### About Dataset
#### Context:
LEGO is a popular brand of toy building bricks. They are often sold in sets with in order to build a specific object. Each set contains a number of parts in different shapes, sizes and colors. This database contains information on which parts are included in different LEGO sets. It was originally compiled to help people who owned some LEGO sets already figure out what other sets they could build with the pieces they had.

#### Content:
This dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database. These files are current as of July 2017. If you need it to be more recent data, you can use Rebrickable’s API which provides up to date data, and additional features.

#### Acknowledgements:
This dataset was compiled by Rebrickable, which is a website to help identify what LEGO sets can be built given bricks and pieces from other LEGO sets. You can use these files for any purpose.

##### Inspiration:
This is a very rich dataset that offers lots of rooms for exploration, especially since the “sets” file includes the year in which a set was first released.
